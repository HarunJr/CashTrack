# CashTrack

CashTrack is a record taking app used to record cash collected in the bus PSV industry by conductors after each trip. It stores the data in a remote server as well as calculates the total income collected and expenses incurred. 

## Project Overview
As part of my Udacity Capstone Project - Android Developer Nanodegree, I design and plan and build my own app idea. The goal is to take the skills Iâ€™ve learnt across the Nanodegree journey and apply it to an app idea of my own that solves a real-world problem at the same time.

## What was learned
*	Planning the Design and implementation of a unique app idea
*	How to communicate an app idea formally using a description and a UI flow mock
*	Experience to own the full development cycle of an app

## Features
*	Create User
*	Add Vehicle
*	Add Collection/Expense
*	Display total collection and expense per vehicle
*	Calculate balance per vehicle
*	PIN authentication
*	Periodic **notification** reminders
